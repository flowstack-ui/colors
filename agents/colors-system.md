# FLOWSTACK Colors system

## Purpose

Select, execute, and review deterministic color operations without assigning component semantics or hiding changes to source colors.

## Decision order

1. Identify whether the task is inspection, conversion, measurement, raw-reference lookup, candidate generation and review, or provenance recording.
2. Preserve the exact source color unless the caller explicitly requests a bounded adaptation policy.
3. Keep conversion, gamut mapping, contrast, and perceptual difference as distinct reported operations.
4. For palette work, declare the intended profile and every exact interface reference surface before generation.
5. Review the deterministic candidate explicitly and retain its generation and engine provenance.
6. Hand only reviewed serialized candidates to Theme for semantic mapping and exact Brick contract validation.
7. Let the application or authorized project process make final brand and product-use decisions.

## Selection map

- **parse, normalize, or validate a supported color value:** use Color inspection. Use parseColor for syntax, normalizeColor for a serializable record, and validateColor for structured diagnostics.
- **convert a color space or explicitly map a color into an output gamut:** use Color conversion and gamut mapping. Conversion does not silently imply gamut mapping; request and report mapping separately.
- **measure exact contrast or perceptual difference:** use Color contrast and difference measurement. Measure exact pairs and provide an explicit backdrop before making a claim about translucent colors.
- **retrieve a stable named FLOWSTACK palette:** use Named palette reference. Treat the result as raw-reference data; step positions do not confer UI meaning or accessibility.
- **generate, inspect, and explicitly accept or reject a deterministic palette candidate:** use Palette candidate generation and review. Acceptance covers declared Colors measurements only; Theme and rendered Brick qualification remain separate.
- **record the source, engine, package, and transformation evidence for a color result:** use Color provenance. Keep provenance serializable and preserve the exact qualified engine version.
- **assign accent, danger, warning, success, information, surface, or text meaning:** use Theme semantic mapping after explicit candidate review. Colors never infers component or project semantics from hue or palette position.

## Rules

- **MUST:** Treat Colors output as a candidate until a person or explicitly authorized project process approves it and Theme maps and validates its exact values.
- **MUST:** Preserve exact source colors by default; adapt only under an explicit bounded policy and report the perceptual change.
- **MUST:** Make accessibility claims only for exact measured foreground and background pairs.
- **MUST:** Do not infer accent, danger, warning, success, or information meaning merely from hue or palette position.
- **MUST:** Keep Colors out of React, the DOM, Brick, Theme, and the ordinary application browser runtime; exchange serializable artifacts with Theme.
- **MUST:** Pin the qualified color engine exactly and treat its recorded version as part of deterministic provenance.
- **MUST:** Do not regenerate an accepted Theme merely because Colors is upgraded; review candidate diffs and repeat semantic and rendered qualification.
- **MUST:** Keep conversion and gamut mapping separate and report the method and perceptual change whenever a color is mapped.
- **MUST:** Do not claim contrast or perceptual difference for a translucent color without an explicit backdrop.
- **MUST:** Treat accepted as passing only the candidate's declared Colors measurements; Theme mapping and rendered Brick qualification remain separate gates.
- **MUST:** Record an explicit review decision before giving a serialized candidate to Theme and preserve its exact generation evidence.
- **MUST:** Supply every intended interface reference surface when a family must work across canvas, raised, overlay, or similar backgrounds.
- **MUST:** Keep named FLOWSTACK palettes labelled raw-reference and do not infer interface semantics or accessibility from their step positions.

## Native and higher-layer handoff

1. Check the six Colors operations before writing a new color parser, converter, mapper, measurement, candidate generator, named palette lookup, or provenance envelope.
2. Use Theme for semantic mapping and an application or authorized project process for final brand approval; do not rebuild those owners inside Colors.
3. Report the exact unsupported operation, input, output, backdrop, or higher-layer decision when a Colors owner does not apply.

## Validation checklist

- Confirm the selected operation matches the task and every input uses a supported serialized color shape.
- Verify parsing and normalization preserve the source while conversion and gamut mapping report their distinct outcomes.
- Verify contrast and difference claims identify the exact opaque pair or an explicit qualified backdrop.
- For candidates, inspect profile, appearances, exact reference surfaces, preservation policy, diagnostics, measurements, status, and deterministic output.
- Confirm explicit review and complete provenance precede Theme interchange and that accepted is not described as Theme-qualified.
- Confirm no React, DOM, Brick, Theme, application, private brand data, random generation, or hidden semantic inference entered the operation.
- Resolve the installed package manifest and coverage report and confirm all six operation owners and all 76 public API surfaces are covered.
