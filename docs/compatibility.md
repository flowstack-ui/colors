# Compatibility and upgrades

Colors has three separate compatibility boundaries. Keeping them separate
prevents a package upgrade from silently changing an accepted product theme.

## Package API

The npm package follows semantic versioning. Version `0.1.0` requires Node.js
22 or newer and exposes ESM JavaScript and TypeScript declarations from the
root package entry point.

Before `1.0.0`, a minor version may contain a breaking API or candidate-shape
change when the changelog and migration guidance identify it. Patch releases
must remain compatible with the documented 0.1 API unless they close a safety
or correctness defect that cannot be fixed compatibly.

## Serialized schemas

These identifiers version serialized meaning independently of npm:

- `flowstack.colors-request.v1`;
- `flowstack.colors-candidate.v1`;
- `flowstack.color-record.v1`; and
- `flowstack.color-provenance.v1`.

Additive optional evidence may remain within version 1. Removing required
fields, changing existing field meaning, or making a formerly valid document
invalid requires a new schema identifier or an explicit migration.

Theme consumes the candidate JSON shape, not Colors package code. A reviewed
0.1 candidate therefore remains editable and compilable without rerunning its
generator merely because Colors is upgraded.

## Algorithm and exact values

Candidate provenance records the Colors producer version, exact color-engine
version, operation contract, and `flowstack-palette-v1` algorithm. Version
0.1.0 pins the qualified engine to `4.0.2`; consumer installation cannot
silently substitute another engine while claiming that provenance.

Identical normalized input, package version, engine version, and algorithm
parameters produce byte-identical output. A future intentional generation
model receives a new algorithm identifier. A correctness fix may change exact
candidate values only with a package version change, changelog entry, golden
fixture update, Theme contract requalification, and rendered evidence when the
change affects UI output.

Do not automatically regenerate an accepted project theme during dependency
installation. Review the candidate diff, record a new human decision, scaffold
an ordinary Theme again, and repeat the relevant contract and product gates.

## Moving from qualification builds

`0.1.0` is the first public release. Private `0.0.0` qualification checkouts
should replace Git or workspace references with the exact registry version:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @flowstack-ui/colors@0.1.0
```

The finalized candidate uses `review`, plural `referenceBackgrounds`, and the
neutral `textInverse` role. Regenerate experimental pre-0.1 candidate files,
review them explicitly, and qualify their resulting Theme rather than editing
old experimental envelopes in place.
